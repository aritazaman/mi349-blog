    <ol>
        <li>I wake up at <strong>7:25 AM</strong> and get ready for the day. </li>
        <li>At <strong>7:45 AM</strong>, I leave my dorm and start walking towards the <em>STEM Building</em></li>
        <li>I use a combo to for breakfast at the STEM Workshop. 
            <ul>
                <li>I get water, a peach yogurt, and a blueberry bagel with cream cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I head into the lecture hall at <strong>8:30</strong> for <a href="https://reg.msu.edu/courses/request.aspx?subjectcode=cse#Results:~:text=CSE%C2%A0380%C2%A0%C2%A0Information%20Management%20and%20the%20Cloud" target="_blank">CSE 380</a>.</li>

        <li>When my math lecture ends at <strong>11:40</strong>, I head towards <em>Snyder-Phillips</em> for lunch. 
            <ul>
                <li>The lunch menu is different everyday there, but I really love SnyPhi's cheesy bread and their chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I head to my friends apartment and study there until <strong>3PM</strong>, where I head to <em>Bessey Hall</em>.</li>
        <li>Until <strong>4:20</strong>, I sit through my <a href="https://reg.msu.edu/courses/request.aspx?subjectcode=cse#Results:~:text=CSE%C2%A0260%C2%A0%C2%A0Discrete%20Structures%20in%20Computer%20Science" target="_blank">CSE 260</a> lecture. </li>
        <li>When the lecture ends, I go to the <em>STEM Building</em> to get some more work done, until AI Club @ <strong>6pm</strong>.</li>
        <li>I attend the AI Club meeting until <strong>7pm</strong>, and once that ends I've had a long day and head back to my dorm. </li>
